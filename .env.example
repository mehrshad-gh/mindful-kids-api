# Optional: credential document uploads (therapist application).
# On Railway: add a volume with mount path /data so uploads persist across deploys (stored under /data/uploads/credentials).
# Railway sets RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH at runtime when a volume is attached.
# BASE_URL=https://your-api.up.railway.app   # so upload response URLs are absolute
# UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads   # fallback when not using /data (e.g. local dev)

# Clinic invite: set-password link base. If unset in production, defaults to mindfulkids:// so the link opens the mobile app.
# For mobile app deep link (recommended): CLINIC_INVITE_BASE_URL=mindfulkids://
# For web app: CLINIC_INVITE_BASE_URL=https://app.mindfulkids.com
# CLINIC_INVITE_BASE_URL=mindfulkids://

# Optional: send "You are approved — set your password" email to clinic contact when admin approves.
# If not set, the set_password_link is returned in the approve API response and logged for manual sending.
