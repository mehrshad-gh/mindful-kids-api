# Admin promotion (for npm run set-admin):
# ALLOW_ADMIN_PROMOTION=true

# Optional: credential document uploads (therapist application).
# On Railway: add a volume with mount path /data so uploads persist across deploys (stored under /data/uploads/credentials).
# Railway sets RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH at runtime when a volume is attached.
# BASE_URL=https://your-api.up.railway.app   # so upload response URLs are absolute
# UPLOAD_DIR=./uploads   # fallback when not using /data (e.g. local dev)

# Clinic invite: set-password link base. Use HTTPS to avoid "invalid address" when opening from email.
# 1) Recommended: host static/set-password.html at https://yourdomain.com/set-password (e.g. Vercel, Netlify, or any static host).
#    Then set: CLINIC_INVITE_BASE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
#    The page redirects to the app (mindfulkids://app/set-password?token=...) so the link always works.
# 2) Direct deep link (can fail in Mail/Safari on iOS): CLINIC_INVITE_BASE_URL=mindfulkids://app
# CLINIC_INVITE_BASE_URL=https://app.mindfulkids.com

# Optional: send "You are approved — set your password" email to clinic contact when admin approves.
# If not set, the set_password_link is returned in the approve API response and logged for manual sending.
